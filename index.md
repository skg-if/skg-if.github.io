# Welcome to SKG-IF documentation!

This documentation provides an overview of the work started by the RDA Interest Group on
[Open Science Graphs for FAIR Data](https://rd-alliance.org/groups/open-science-graphs-fair-data-ig) 
towards the definition of the **Scientific Knowledge Graphs Interoperability Framwork** (**SKG-IF**).

Currently, the work has been handed over to the RDA Working Group on [Scientific Knowledge Graphs - Interoperability Framework](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/scientific-knowledge-graphs-interoperability-framework-skg-if-wg), which has been endorsed in June 2023.
