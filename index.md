# Welcome to SKG-IF documentation!

This documentation provides an overview of the work started by the RDA Interest Group on
[Open Science Graphs for FAIR Data](https://rd-alliance.org/groups/open-science-graphs-fair-data-ig) 
towards the definition of the **Scientific Knowledge Graphs Interoperability Framwork** (**SKG-IF**).

Currently, the work has been handed over to the RDA Working Group on [Scientific Knowledge Graphs - Interoperability Framework](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/scientific-knowledge-graphs-interoperability-framework-skg-if-wg), which has been endorsed in June 2023.

## How to contribute
If you are interested in participating in the discussion around the SKG-IF, two (non-mutually exclusive) options are available:
- if you wish to **contribute and consolidate the SKG-IF core model** and the processes for its development and maintenance, please subscribe to the [Scientific Knowledge Graphs - Interoperability Framework](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/scientific-knowledge-graphs-interoperability-framework-skg-if-wg). At the moment (2024), the WG meets twice per month, on the first and third Fridays. Once you join the RDA WG, you should receive all the due communications about our meetings and agenda points. 
- if you are interested in **extending the SKG-IF to address specific requirements** and/or use cases currently not covered by the proposed core model, please read the documentation about [extensions](https://skg-if.github.io/extensions/) and apply for a new one. Extensions follow a separate development/maintenance from the core model, and therefore, their delivery can be fast-paced as long as it meets the expected degree of clearness and compliance. Successful extensions and the aspects they cover can be cherry-picked for inclusion into the core model by the WG.
